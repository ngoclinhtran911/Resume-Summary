### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Impact of high-tech parks on the regional economic growth of Vietnam and the spillover effect 
Methods: Difference in Difference, Staggered DID, Spatial DID\
Programming Language: R

Employing the Difference-in-Differences (DID) method to analyze the impact of high-tech zone establishment on regional economic growth and Spatial Difference-in-Differences (SDID) to further discern the spilloerver effect of high-tech zones, on the data from 40 prefecture-level cities and provinces in key economic regions in Vietnam from 1990 to 2022. The results unveil a positive significant impact of high-tech parks on the economic growth, but no clear evidence of the spillover effect. It also display the disparity in economy level between three areas - Northern, Southern and Central in Vietnam.
